I live in Shanghai for a while, in the last year of my 2-year stay in Shanghai, I started to prefering staying at home whenever I could, because I was becoming claustrophobic when I go out and seeing crowds (big crowds are everywhere in Shanghai) before I've ever heard the word \\\"claustrophobic\\\".

Yes, the ocean is like a sensitive thermometer, it would be affected drastically, but in my opinion, the disastrous events happening in the ocean would be easier to avoid as a family when compared to sudden wildfires & toxic smokes when all your life belongings are in one house, and a car can only take so much luggage, not to even mention the blocked traffic when evacuating.
