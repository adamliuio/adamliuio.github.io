  <div class="content"><p><strong>I'm scared of climate change</strong>, not only because it will bring significant &amp; unavoidable changes to our lives, but also because the reason we are only starting to take it seriously recently (2021), is because <strong>climate change is not only a climate issue</strong>, but rather a significant part of it is the human politics, human irresponsibility, and the short sighted nature we all have.</p>
<p>That's why I said <em><strong>&ldquo;human &amp; environmental impact&rdquo;</strong></em>, at the end of the day, the environment behaves according to the natural laws, we are here to take from it and make it suit our needs. Now, I have no power to help in any aspect in terms of climate change on a big scale as an individual at the moment, while I do want to build my businesses asap and make sure I have enough time and money to help reducing climate change, I also want to make life more secure for my family.</p>
<p>Watching situations like shown in <a href="https://youtu.be/wgtoHYMZV1c">this video</a> always makes me sad. No matter it's natural disasters or human destructions, generations of memories and histories would be gone without any merci, or ways of avoiding it.</p>
<p>Beside this, wildfires are getting much more often and harder to be put out, <a href="https://youtu.be/-iCuFYf8mdI">the smokes it creates would really make people's lives miserable</a> without destroying their properties.</p>
<p>I believe we are moving into an age of new ways of housing. Shelter, this ancient &amp; essential idea that most living beings need, is embracing some new ideas in the human world. <strong><em>Movement</em> is part of these important new ideas.</strong> And boats deliver the ultimate movement. Yes, the ocean is like a sensitive thermometer, it would be affected drastically by global warming, but in my opinion, the disastrous events affecting boats would be easier to avoid as a family if compared to disasters (like sudden wildfires &amp; toxic smokes) happening on land affecting people's properties and all the life belongings in these properties, and a car can only take so much luggage &amp; operate on roads that suit, not to even mention the blocked traffic when evacuating.</p>
<p>While a boat is definitely not the perfect solution, but it's definitely better than anything else I can imagine.</p>
