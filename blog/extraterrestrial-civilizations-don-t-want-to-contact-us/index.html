  <div class="content"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediocrity_principle">Mediocrity Principle</a> states:&ldquo;if an item is drawn at random from one of several sets or categories, it's likelier to come from the most numerous category than from any one of the less numerous categories&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Following this logic, there's nothing special about us, as well as anything we are aware of: our intelligence, civilisation, planet, galaxy, etc, unless it's proven otherwise.</p>
<p>Our technologies are extremely primitive when compared to the tech that the theorised Type II &amp; Type III civilisations (<a href="/blog/kardashev-scale" alt="Kardashev scale">[[Kardashev scale]]</a>) might have, which allow us to see only the neighbouring parts of the universe.</p>
<p>The star-formation rate density of the universe (13.8 billion years old) peaked approximately <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0007">3.5 billion years</a> after the Big Bang, most stars are much older than our sun (4.603 billion years old) have have already became white dwarfs, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14812.pdf">around half of all sun-like stars host an earth-size planet in their habitable zone</a>. If the planetary systems of any of these much older stars contain life, they might be billions of years ahead of us.</p>
<p>So far, our civilisation has not evolved to the level that is capable of discovering extraterrestrial life, so the civilisations we talk about in the possibilities below would be the ones much more advanced than us.</p>
<p>So here are some possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Extraterrestrial civilizations have already visited Earth, but they came before we were here, or we could record history.</strong></p>
<p>If they've been here already before life was here, then why didn't they stay? Maybe they came at a time that was so far before us, earth was not habitable for them (btw, if they can travel all the way to earth to figure this out, they might have never physically been here, but rather, a rover like <em>Perseverance</em> would do the job and get them the information they needed)? Or maybe life would appear differently on other planets, so even if they came at a time that earth has already became friendly for life like what we have now, it's not as friendly to they as to us?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They have been colonising the galaxy, but just haven't reached our part of the galaxy yet.</strong></p>
<p>While as other suggest that exponential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_colonization#Self-replication">self-replicating</a> is the best scenario for space colonisation, there might be challenges that would make it much slower and more diffcult than how we've imagined it would be since we are still far from making it an reality.</p>
<p>Or, maybe they are colonising the galaxy at an exponential rate right now, but they still haven't reached our part of the galaxy, just like the untouched indigenous in the Amazon are not aware of how much the world have changed. Which means, the reason we are not aware of them is because we are the primitive creatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>They are observing us (the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_hypothesis">Zoo Hypothesis</a>”.)</strong></p>
<p>We might be the candidates of some kind of experiment extraterrestrial civilisations are conducting in order to test their hypothesis or to get certain results. So earth, or even our planetary system is the zoo for us to wonder around, and figure out what we are capable of achieving.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is a much better theory than the simulation theory. And also, the whole &ldquo;<a href="/blog/great-filter" alt="Great Filter"><a href="/blog/great-filter" alt="Great Filter">[[Great Filter]]</a></a>&rdquo; for us would be the very extraterrestrial civilisations we are looking for, just like zookeepers for animals in captivity, they will decide what happen to us every step of the way. And also, it would be almost impossible for us to find out is there any &ldquo;<a href="/blog/great-filter" alt="Great Filter"><a href="/blog/great-filter" alt="Great Filter">[[Great Filter]]</a></a>&rdquo; for them.</p>
