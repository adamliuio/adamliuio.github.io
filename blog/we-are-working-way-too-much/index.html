  <div class="content"><p>As humans, we simply work too much. In my opinion, most people have become the <a href="/blog/the-industrialised-humans" alt="The industrialised humans">[[The industrialised humans]]</a>. Most of us work like machines and this way of working has been widely accepted as a social norm. Because the societies around the globe have been measuring the quality of the livelihood by GDP for decades, productivity has become the one thing different countries and cities chase after.</p>
<p>In most western countries, people work the standard 9-to-5 days up to 40 hours per week. In China, working 996 (work 9am to 9pm everyday, for 6 days a week, which is 72 hours per week) has become a social norm.</p>
<p>Let's do the math.</p>
<p>When you have a normal 9-to-5 job, you're working 40 hours per week. <em>On the surface</em>, your job consumes 40 / (24 * 7) = <em><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->23.8%<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></em> of your life. But this is not even close to reality. Why?</p>
<p>As normal human beings, we are not machines (even machines need rest/resets/adjustments), right? We sleep <em>8 hours</em> on average (give or take). So the life we remember and enjoy consciously, is actually (24 * 7) - (8 * 7) = <em><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->112<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></em> hours instead of (24 * 7) = <em><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->168<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></em>. When you calculate like this, a 9-to-5 job would consume 40 / 112 = <em><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->35.7%<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></em></p>
<p>How about the 996 situation in China? The number goes up to 72 / 112 = <em><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->64.3%<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></em></p>
<p>The numbers above is just a rough calculation, there is more to it.</p>
<p>The time you spend on a job is normally the best time of your day, most people rush to work in the morning by taking crowded public transportation or by driving on jammed roads, by the time you're done for the day, you don't have much energy &amp; time left to give to your loved ones.</p>
